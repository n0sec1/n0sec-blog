## Refunding Services

A refunding service is pretty simple and the concept of 'refunding' has been present before the internet. A refund is just returning an item to a store, there is unlimited reasons to refund an item, sometimes the item doesn't arrive in the first place, sometimes it has a defect, there are real reasons to refund an item. However, these fraudsters are taking advantage of companies in order to socially engineer them to provide a refund for a product without a defect, with no intent of returning the item to the vendor. This 'refunding abuse' scheme accounts for \$27 [billion dollars worth of](https://apprisscorp.com/retail/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/01/AR3019-2019-Customer-Returns-in-the-Retail-Industry.pdf) returns annually.

Refunds are conducted through many different means, and the goal of this article is to cover the different means of refunding. Refunding is typically specialized for each company, as companies different have refund policies, but many overlap. Therefore there is an array of methods, but some need to be modified slightly depending on the company. Not all refund methods are applicable to every store, some refund methods will never work for certain stores.

## Refund as a Service (RaaS) and the Restraints

RaaS, refunding as a service (not to be confused with ransomware as a service!), is common amongst the two forums [Cracked.io](https://cracked.io) and [Nulled.to](https://www.nulled.to), where refunders are found in abundance. Refunds are typically done anywhere for 10-20% of the value of the order, with limitations for each company. Some companies are limited in the amount of money that is safe to refund, for instance it is much harder to refund \$20,000 USD than it is \$100. Some companies are more aware of refunding and are willing to sacrifice 'reputability' as a company to fight refunders by being less likely to grant a refund, so the limits are lower to be safer. Additionally, sometimes the amount of items in an order is limited because some methods of refunding don't make sense with a high item count, for instance, if I claim a package didn't arrive, that's much more belieavable than saying 5 packages all shipped separately didn't arrive. A parcel service is far less likely to make a mistake on 5 packages opposed to 1 package. Additionally, another restriction of refunding is the waiting period. When refunding, it requires that the person who places the order has the upfront capital to pay for the items, and typically the items are being refunded because the person cannot "afford" to buy the items at the actual store price. So, people prefer to receive the refund to their bank account quicker, but some stores make customers wait 3-4 weeks for refunds depending on the method used. This can be a deterrent for refunding clients, as they don't want their money tied up in that order for weeks, because in some cases they need that money back quickly (hence why they're refunding the item fraudulently).

RaaS is sold via two means primarily, via Discord/Telegram servers and automated websites. [Refund.army](https://refund.army/shoplist) and [Refunding.team](http://refunding.team) is an example of an automated site that accepts orders for cryptocurrency, while the refunds aren't automatic, the customer has the comfort of placing the refund order instantly without having to wait on responses from multiple vendors. Nearly any store can be refunded and manual refunders can be found on Cracked.io and Nulled.to in surplus.

Typically, stores have spreadsheets of the sites that they're able to refund. This includes the package limits (the amount of items you can order from the store), the maximum amount of money that the refunders can refund for the customer confidently, and the estimated time it will take for the refund to return to the customer's bank account. It also specifies the limits for different regions, as stores handle refunds differently depending on what area you refund from, an American refund policy might be different than a French refund policy for a store like Amazon. Additionally, some refunders charge a variable-rate depending on the store, so it specifies the rate charged for the specific store.

## 'DNA', 'EB/PEB', 'DMG', Missing item, Wrong Item, Sealed Box, etc.

When learning refunding, there is a lot of lingo to be understood. There are different means of beginning a refund at a company, the refund method must be specialized based on the store's return conditions. The applications and specifics of this will be explained with each method discussed in this article.

'Did not arrive', or DNA, is somewhat self explanatory. It's a claim that the customer didn't receive the package to their address. This is typically optimal for small items that may have not been delivered, it is much more noticeable and rememberable to deliver a refridgerator than it is a box with some Airpods in it. The refunder then tell the victim company 2 days after the package has been received that the package has in-fact not been received. Typically this is done via phone call or live chat with the company, the goal is the same regardless, the refunder must socially engineer the phone representative to believe them and lead them to the conclusion that the package wasn't delivered. Frequently carriers will open an investigation for this type of claim, which means that the refund has practically failed, so the refunder typically hangs up and tries to go to the next representative as quickly as possible. This is because sometimes the representative leave account notes that can be negative, thereby switching to the next live chat as soon as possible is optimal to avoid the reputation of the account being damaged in the account notes. Typically, this category of refunds is nowhere near optimal for refunders and is only used for low-value orders.

Empty box, EB, along with PEB, partially empty box, however has a higher success rate. This claim once again is rather intuitive, the refunder claims that a package was delivered, but it didn't have any item inside the package, a warehouse error basically. This is typically the fault of the company, and not the parcel service, thereby it is more adaptable to various compaies. The partially empty box method is used for orders with multiple items in the order, and typically refunders claim that the cheapest item arrived but the most expensive one did not. So if someone ordered a PS5, a red shirt, and a cat toy, they would claim that the cat toy and red shirt arrived, but not the PS5. This typically resutls in a partial refund, which sometimes is fine if set up properly by the refunder and the person ordering. Sometimes when executing this method, the company will request you ship back the box, and typically the refunder tries to claim they can't, but worst comes to worse, they can actually just ship back the box but empty, this just increases the waiting time for the refund. An important objective is to slightly push the phone represnetative to believe that it was a warehouse error opposed to a parcel service error, as many companies aren't liable for parcel errors. This refunding method is also said to not be optimal for amounts over \$1,000 for many companies.

Damaged, or DMG, is a rather atypical method but is sometimes used in conjunction with other more advanced methods. Basically, the refunder claims that the item came damaged in some sort of way. There are more complex applications of this such as the 'leaking battery' or 'shattered glass' method, which claim that the item came defective, just specifying a reason for the item being defective. Typically, the victim company will asks for one of two things, images of the damaged item, or for the customer to ship back the item. Refunders have various options here, they can ship back an empty box or use more complex 'fake tracking ID' methods that will be later discussed, or fake photo evidence. This fake photo evidence can just be photoshopped imagery of other broken glass, but commonly, people do the 'corrupted file' method. The corrupted file method is rather simple, the refunder sends files that won't open to the victim company, and the refunder will sometimes just give up and issue a refund without the item. This doesn't always work, but is an option for some companies. Fake tracking IDs are typically an easier solution, but they require more work.

The wrong item method, once again, is rather intuitive, the refunder claims that the item received wasn't the item purchased in the order. This method is once again a warehouse error and is more universally useful. The refunder must first purchase the item that they will claim they received (opposed to the item they should have received), and the item must be near the weight of the item that is intended for the customer to keep. An example of this method is a customer ordering a pair of \$10 headphones and a pair of Airpods, they weigh similar weights. The customer would order both from the same store on two different accounts, and then claim that the more expensive package wasn't received, but instead the 'random item' that the refunder obviously will not mention that they ordered themself. The victim company will typically ask for the customer to return the incorrect item, which they can, and in exchange the company will refund them for the more expensive item. This method however, when investigated, can turn against the refunder if they didn't take the proper precautions ordering the item that is 'incorrect', such as if both packages are ordered to the same address, the company may realize what just happened (despite them being on two different accounts).

The sealed box method is simple, the refunder sends in a refund to the victim company claiming that they didn't end up needing the item, and ship back the box 'factory sealed'. Factory sealed indicates that the box was never opened, so the company is less likely to open the package. The refunder takes the item out of the box, puts in dry ice or sand to weigh down the package, and then tries to reseal the box as well as they can. This only works on items that are fully covered by the cardboard box and the seal must be kept in tact, which isn't too hard.
