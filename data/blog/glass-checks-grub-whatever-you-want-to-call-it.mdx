## What is glass, food, and grub?

Recently amongst blackhat communities primarily located on Telegram, check fraud has developed into a prominent and highly profitable form of fraud. Since the conception of checks, check fraud has followed and somewhat tarnished the reputation of checks. However, many forms of check fraud are abusing trust between two parties, one party trust that a check will not 'bounce' (the check will be redeemable for the amount agreed upon), and the other party is expected to give a check with the agreed balance. However, sometimes people will give checks knowing that their account balance won't be able to cover the balance of the check, resulting in the party who received the check being swindled out of their money, and frequently whatever asset they gave to the person in exchange for the check. Lately, new forms of highly profitable check fraud have developed however, using cybercrime techniques fraudsters are able to create false checks or modify real, existing checks to steal thousands of dollars from the government, banks, and people.

Glass, food, and grub are all synonyms for the term 'check', however typically used to refer to a check that is falsified or being abused. 'Glass' refers to a check that is stolen, typically from a mailbox, meanwhile 'food' and 'grub' refer to checks that were found by any means, however are modified using software such as Adobe's Photoshop or the check-modifying and printing software [Check Builder Pro](https://checkbuilderpro.com). The act of modifying a check by such means is normally referred to as ‘cooking up’ a check amongst fraudsters. There are various ways which fraudsters obtain checks to modify, however the end goal is nearly always identical. The fraudster hopes to deposit checks to a ‘drop bank’, an account that is under someone else’s identity, which they can then withdrawal from to cash or to cryptocurrency. This drop bank sometimes can be the bank account of a person who the fraudsters made a deal with, who may or may not what is going on, or it can be a bank account opened falsely under someone else’s name and personally identifying information. My goal with this article is to show the various means of check fraud and bank fraud that are popular amongst the blackhat communities I have insight on.

## Drops

One of the most extensively written about topics on this site are bank account open-ups. In both [this article about various accounts for receiving funds without holds](https://www.n0sec.io/blog/the-market-for-verified-accounts) and [this article about identity theft to create bank accounts](https://www.n0sec.io/blog/the-market-for-your-driver-license-ssn-and-more), I explained how fraudsters are able to make bank accounts under other people’s names for malicious purposes like this. Because the funds involved in operations like these are obviously blackhat and easily detectable by the bank, fraudsters look to outsource risk to unknowing citizens who have their identity stolen to create a bank account, or friends who have bank accounts. It is not rare for fraudsters to go on their social medias and post, looking to get in contact with people willing to take risk their freedom for a quick dollar. Fraudsters will look for people with specific bank accounts, such as Truist or Bank of America, and work out a deal with the people to deposit illegal funds into their account, which the fraudster and the account owner will then split. This makes the account owner a target for law enforcement if the law enforcement chooses to trace the illicit funds. The reason that this is necessary is because often freshly opened banks have heightened security measures associated with them, meaning the bank is likely to flag a mobile deposit of any large amount, however on an account that has been opened for a long time and has a high volume of transactions, the bank is more likely to approve the deposit. The only exception to this is bank insiders, who will approve the deposit for the fraudster at a fee, but these are rare to come by as the bank insider, similar to the drop account owner, is risking their freedom for a quick dollar.

The main factors that make a drop ‘good’ for the purposes of receiving falsified checks is having been open for multiple months and having a decent volume of transactions essentially. Depending on the bank, the exact numbers vary, however the principle is consistent. This same idea is true for receiving transfers and wires from compromised bank accounts.

## Glass

Glass, as previously mentioned, are checks stolen from mailboxes. The classic porch pirates have evolved to overnight thievery, where they look through hundreds of mailboxes, looking specifically for checks in the mail. While a check not addressed to you may seem useless, fraudsters can use the aforementioned ‘cookup’ technique to change the receiving details of the check to match the fraudster’s bank drop accounts. The act of going from mailbox to mailbox looking for checks is commonly referred to as ‘mail phishing’ and seems to be popular amongst fraudsters as this technique is inexpensive and can be executed almost instantly. There are more advanced renditions of this, such as mail phishers obtaining mail keys to apartment complexes and having access to many locked mailboxes, which also looks far less suspicious than driving house-to-house stealing mail. The typical night of a mail phisher is simple, the mail phisher is expected to take as much mail as possible, and filter through to find the valuables. This includes money orders and checks. With ordinary checks, the process is rather simple, the fraudster uses software such as Photoshop to change the name on the check to the name on the drop bank account, and then has three options. Depending on the bank, the fraudster can use mobile deposit, an ATM that accepts check deposits, and the fraudster can go to the bank branch in-person to redeem the check, a rather risky approach that is typically outsourced. With a money order, while many people walk into stores with real money orders, fraudsters typically stick to ATM deposit or mobile deposit to avoid any sort of identity verification. A money order ranges up to \$1,000 in USD, which means that to make a significant amount of money, fraudsters attempt to process many money orders simultaneously, typically to different bank accounts to avoid raising suspicion. If any information on the money order is inconsistent with the drop bank, most of the time is a simple photoshop job to change the information and make the money order likely to be approved by the receiving bank.

## Cookups

Cookups are far more consistent than the previously discussed glass. Cookups in the blackhat community refer to checks that are changed to fit criteria of compromised bank account information. Typically, the templates for cookups however come from stolen mail, so there is overlap between the two fields.
