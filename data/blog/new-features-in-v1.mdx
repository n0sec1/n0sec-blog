## What is cracking?
Cracking is a way that threat actors can gain access to accounts of nearly any platform. Hackers crack simple things like pizza accounts all the way to cryptocurrency exchange logins for profit.

## Combolist
Cracking is perpetrated through combolist. A combolist is a long list of emails and passwords, obtained via leaked databases.
Leaked databases are a result of companies being compromised and having their database of users along with their corresponding email and password breached. This can be done in many ways, but a very popular way is finding vulnerable sites and performing a 'SQL injection' on them. This results in the files from the database being breached, which typically contain user information.
These leaked databases are obviously very valuable, especially if they contain massive amounts of user data. Not all databases are equal, massive sites like LinkedIn have far more login credentials than a random local coffee website would have, thereby a LinkedIn database is worth more. Database sales can be found on nearly any darknet marketplace, one particularly active marketplace I came across is RaidForums.

Before or after sale the database then has to be decrypted. Nearly every large company database is encrypted, meaning that the passwords aren't in just typical plaintext for a hacker to use. They have to be decrypted using software like Hashcat. Some databases are sold pre-decrypted while some are sold and leave it to the buyer to decrypt. It is nearly impossible to crack every 'hash', or encrypted password, with the latest encryption technology, but many crackers are able to decrypt a fair amount of hashed passwords. The decrypting of passwords itself is known as 'hash cracking', not to be confused with 'account cracking'.
Hash cracking isn't completely effective for hackers and is the reason why many companies advise you to have long, complicated passwords. Hash cracking basically involves the following:
    1. A large database of passwords is found, such as the rockyou.txt database. This is basically a compilation of commonly used passwords in plaintext.
    2. The database is then encrypted into the encryption algorithm that the site that is being targeted is utilizing. For instance, if a site has their database leaked and the hash is detected to be a MD5 hash, then you would convert rockyou.txt to be encrypted MD5 strings.
    3. Now, basically a mass brute force attack is scaled with the dictionary of plaintext passwords and their encrypted equivalent against the leaked database. If any of the dictionary's newly generated MD5 hashes matches the leaked database's MD5 hashes, this means that the plaintext for the newly generated dictionary is the password for that particular hash in the original database. Basically, tools like Hashcat just test a variety of predicted passwords against the website and do so at massive amounts of request per second at ranges above millions of hashes per second.
    4. Once all the possible hashes find their corresponding password, the non-decrypted passwords are removed and the database is ready to be used for malicious purposes.
In these leaked databases, the format is typically email:password, seperated by a colon to make the email and password readable by the software used to crack the logins. Not all databases involve a password, sometimes mailing list get leaked. This is valuable because someone on a mailing list for a cryptocurrency site is likely to have cryptocurrency, making them a good target for other types of hacks. It is worth noting that there are services that will search emails across hundreds of terabytes of leaked databases and find every piece of information related to that email through leaked databases. This is done through services like [Intelx](https://intelx.io) and [Dehashed](https://dehashed.com).
Combolist, once obtained, can be put to sale or 'leaked' onto forums to embarrass the company and to further gain credentials for the leaker on that forum. These credentials are basically just respect amongst fellow hackers. Combolist that are leaked are typically more 'saturated', as many people will find them and try to use them to crack accounts. Combolist with still encrypted hashes are a little bit more useful as not as many people are trying to use the database for their purposes, as not everyone has the equipment or knowledge to crack hashes. Individual databases are also sold for massive amounts of money, which is determined by factors like region of the site, size of database, what hash was used to encrypt it, how old the site is, and what the site's purpose is. A cryptocurrency database is very valuable because it provides more value to hackers, as a common goal for hackers is to extract hard-to-trace cryptocurrency out of a victim's account.
There is also database providers who sell access to many databases and post fresh database as a monthly subscription service.
