## Introduction

Social media bots are used to promote social media accounts and inflate statistics of social media accounts, typically in attempts to make an account look more popular than it is. There are many uses for this, such as perputrating social media scams using followers and likes a way to gain trust to the victim, and also using followers as a way to tempt actual users to follow, because many other people follow.

## Instagram Automation Tools

There is a difference between botting a social media to have inflated likes, followers, etc. than using social media automation softwares. Social media automation softwares are often utilized to gain legitimate followers by having the accounts automate activities that gain legitimate followers. An example of this is 'top comment bots' that were popular for a while on the platform, where people would bot the likes of a comment on a post to make a certain comment appear in the top position when someone checks a post's comments. This attracts users to the account and overall increases the outreach of the account that was botted. A more recent version of this is a 'first-comment' bot, that checks certain pages for new post and when one happens the bot makes the given account the first to comment. This also increases outreach and increases the probability of the account being the top comment on the post. Similarly, there are liking bots that will automatically like post, in the hopes that the account owner will notice the like and follow the account back.

One of the more intricate bots are the auto-posters and automated downloader. There are bots that scrape content from Instagram, Tiktok, and YouTube to repost onto an Instagram account. These bots also sometimes automatically generate captions to post to help push the post to potential followers. The more post an account has, the more opportunity it has to reach the explore page of Instagram.
